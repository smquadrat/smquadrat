Hi 👋 My name is Sebastian
==========================

I enjoy building tools that generate insights from raw data using Python libraries such as sklearn to build ML models and Flask to deploy lean prototypes. Past project examples include estimating market maker positioning in option markets and exploring the impact of Federal Reserve money supply levels on equity markets. My professional work includes SaaS (Dropbox) and fintech (startup).
