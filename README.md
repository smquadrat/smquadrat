Hi 👋 My name is Sebastian
==========================

As a data-driven product manager and hobbyist developer I specialize in building tools that generate valuable insights from raw data. I enjoy using Python libraries such as sklearn to build ML models and Flask to deploy lean prototypes. My past projects include estimating options market maker positioning and assessing the impact of Federal Reserve money supply contraction on equity markets. My professional experience includes product work at Dropbox and a fintech startup.
