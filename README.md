Hi 👋 My name is Sebastian
==========================

As a data-driven product manager and hobbyist developer I specialize in building tools that generate valuable insights from raw data. I enjoy using Python libraries such as sklearn to build ML models and Flask to deploy lean prototypes. My past project examples include estimating market maker positioning in option markets and exploring the impact of Federal Reserve money supply levels on equity markets. My professional experience includes work at Dropbox and a fintech startup.
